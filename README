I'm working through Agda tutorial by Divi√°nszky

http://people.inf.elte.hu/divip/AgdaTutorial/

I had some trouble getting Agda to work with Emacs. I had to manually add the path to exec-path as follows:

(setq exec-path (append exec-path '("/usr/texbin" "/Users/marchdown/Library/Haskell/bin")))

~/Library/Haskell/bin is the defaul location cabal from Haskell Platform uses, but I had to look it up with `where agda`. So there. I keep most of my notes in Evernote, but some may leak here.

This repo is mainly for code and LaTeX.

If anyone other than me is reading this, I'm open to questions, suggestions, offers of collaboration &c.
